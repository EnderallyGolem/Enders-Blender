EndHelperTest_Tutorial_RoomSwap_Tutorial=Room-Swap lets you create a rectangular grid of rooms that can be shuffled around.
Each grid of rooms is created by its own {# ffff66}Controller{#}. This must be loaded before/at the same time any other Room-Swap item for that grid is loaded.
The grid consists of {# 0099ff}template rooms{#}, where you place the layout of the rooms in and are unreachable, and {# 0099ff}swapper rooms{#}, which are located where the player accesses but are initially empty.
When the controller is first loaded, the template rooms are copied to the swapper rooms in the default order. This order can then be changed by the {# ffff66}Room-Swap Breaker Box{#} or {# ffff66}Modify Room Trigger{#}.
Note: The grid rooms {# F94A4A}cannot contain foreground/background tiles and collectables.{#}
Foreground and background tiles are not properly copied from the template to swapper rooms. 
(You can use this mod's Tile Entity for foreground tiles, which allows you to connect them to each other and the edge of the screen.)
Collectables are stored per room, so when rooms are moved, a collected collectable might reappear.
Lastly, to ensure respawn points work properly, add a {# ffff66}Respawn Force Same Room Trigger{#} in every room, and use the {# ffff66}Room-Swap Change Respawn Trigger{#} instead of the regular one.
Without them, dying could respawn you in the template room instead of the swapper room.

EndHelperTest_Tutorial_RoomSwap_MapTutorial=The map consists of a background, outline that labels the current position, and room icons.
The background and room icons will automatically be spaced depending on the size of the texture.
The icons should be named {# ffff66}{iconPrefix}{#}{# 0099ff}{row}{#}{# 00ff00}{column}{#}, or {# F94A4A}{levelNumber}{#}{# ffff66}{iconprefix}{#}{# 0099ff}{row}{#}{# 00ff00}{column}{#} for levels above 0. The default level (0) should not have a prefix.
To have animated map, add _{# F94A4A}frameNumber{#} to the end of the texture's name, including the 0th.
In the example here, the left scroll resets the level to 0, while the right scroll increases it by 1. The row 1 col 1 map is animated for level 1.
Both are also set to respawn when you leave the room.

The sprites for the Room-Swap map, map upgrade, and box and were by Pakyjenace.
A lot of code was blatantly plagur-{0.5} i mean modified from SpeedrunTools and VivHelper.
