# Tile Entity
entities.EndHelper/TileEntity.placements.name.normal=Tile Entity
entities.EndHelper/TileEntity.placements.description.normal=Modified VivHelper Custom Depth Tile Entity
entities.EndHelper/TileEntity.attributes.description.tiletypeOffscreen=The portion of the entity that is outside a room will show up as this.\nSet this to an invisible tile ("fake air") and extend the tiles offscreen to allow seemless room transitions.\nAlternatively, add <Tileset id="â—¯" copy="y" path="EndHelper/fakeAir" sound="0"/> to your ForegroundTiles.xml.
entities.EndHelper/TileEntity.attributes.description.extendOffscreen=If the tiles are placed at the edge of the room, they will be extended one tile outside the room.
entities.EndHelper/TileEntity.attributes.description.allowMerge=Allows the tiles to connect to each other.\nBoth tile entities must have this enabled for them to connect.
entities.EndHelper/TileEntity.attributes.description.allowMergeDifferentType=Allows DIFFERENT tiles to connect to each other.\nBoth tile entities must have this and Allow Merge enabled for them to connect.\nNote: Groups of multiple tiles sometimes only connect to those with this enabled (depending on connection order),\neven if the part of the group share the same time.
entities.EndHelper/TileEntity.attributes.description.noEdge=If true, the tiles will have no edge (all parts look like the middle of the tile).\nNote: When merged, as long as one of the parts have this enabled, \nthe full block will act as though this is enabled.
entities.EndHelper/TileEntity.attributes.description.locationSeeded=If true, the tile's seed will depend on its position relative to the room (and width and height).\nThus the randomisation will stay consistent upon room swaps,\nor if teleporting to a room with the tile entity in the same location.
entities.EndHelper/TileEntity.attributes.description.offU=The offscreen tiletype will be used if it extends offscreen to the top
entities.EndHelper/TileEntity.attributes.description.offUR=The offscreen tiletype will be used if it extends offscreen to the top right

# Multiroom Watchtower
entities.EndHelper/MultiroomWatchtower.placements.name.normal=Multi-Room Watchtower
entities.EndHelper/MultiroomWatchtower.placements.description.normal=Watchtower that can scroll through to different rooms.\nNodes work, but it cannot skip rooms, and each room must have at least 1 spot along the nodes that the camera can fit.\nFYI: The player will be stored at the bottom left of the room, but with no hitbox.
entities.EndHelper/MultiroomWatchtower.attributes.description.modifiedInterpolation=If you're using nodes, uses Catmull-Rom Splines instead of whatever vanilla uses for the watchtower path,\nwhich have the advantage of ensuring the camera always goes past nodes, but is less smooth.\nBecareful if this is disabled, if the path does not go through a location where the camera can fit in the room,\nthe watchtower cannot access it and any future rooms!
entities.EndHelper/MultiroomWatchtower.attributes.description.ignoreLookoutBlocker=The lookout bypasses Lookout Blockers.\nThis allows both scrolling past the blockers and looking at rooms past the blockers.\nThis has no effect if nodes are used.
